Summary
A software engineer with a Master’s degree from Aalto University and three years of experience in the automotive
sector. I deeply understand the industry’s characteristics, development processes, and challenges. Highly motivated by
the potential of machine learning, I am eager to further explore its applications within the automotive domain. Over
the next two years, my focus will be on integrating machine learning techniques to optimize processes, enhance
efficiency, and drive innovation in the automotive sector.

Projects
•Camera and LiDAR Calibration Transformer
Mar 2022 - Apr 2023
Master Thesis Project (on going) CamLidCalib (https://github.com/TuyetHan/CamLidCalib_Trans)
Design, implement, and test several transformer architectures on Point Cloud and Camera Image. The objective is not only
